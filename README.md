Software Engineering student focused on backend systems, developer tooling, and large-scale architecture.

I’m particularly interested in understanding how systems work internally — from data structures and storage engines to build systems and dependency modeling. I prefer clean architecture, clear separation of concerns, and solutions that are maintainable over time.

## Technical Background

**Languages**
- Java
- Go
- Python
- C++
- TypeScript

**Backend & Systems**
- Spring Boot (JWT authentication, layered architecture, testing)
- REST API design
- Concurrency and multithreading
- Static hashing and file organization
- Custom data structures (SkipList, Memtable)
- Storage-related concepts (WAL, SSTable, Bloom Filter)

**Other**
- Git (structured workflows and meaningful commits)
- SQL
- Angular
- Android (Java)

## Selected Projects

### Key-Value Engine (Go)
Implementation of a storage-oriented system including:
- SkipList-based Memtable
- Write-Ahead Log
- SSTable concepts
- Bloom Filter

Focus on internal data structures and storage design.

### Ride-Hailing Backend (Spring Boot)
Backend system built with:
- Clean layered architecture
- JWT authentication
- Database migrations
- Unit and integration testing

Focus on structure, maintainability, and system organization.

### Algorithms and Optimization
- 0/1 Knapsack solved using a Genetic Algorithm (Python)
- Graph-based modeling tasks
- Static hashing implementations

## Current Interests

- Build system internals
- Dependency graphs and incremental compilation
- Distributed systems and autoscaling
- Performance-aware backend design
- Developer experience through tooling
